# Restaurant Finder
## CPSC 210 Personal Project
This application stores restaurants and organizes them based on the users' needs. 
Any casual restaurant-goer can input a restaurant and its characteristics such as 
a rating, pricing, hours, and cuisine into a customized collection. The user can then search for a restaurant in any 
collection based on its characteristics. The application can be tailored to the individual, and in turn used by 
any person looking to systematically organize their next meal.

This project interests me because my favourite thing about Vancouver is the number of restaurants to choose 
from. At the same time, I am indecisive and forgetful of where I've enjoyed eating at. This application will solve 
both problems, allowing me to save, categroize, and search for the next restaurant to reccomend or eat at.
